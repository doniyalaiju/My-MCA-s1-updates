    <h1>HTML Frames</h1>
    <p>HTML frames allow you to divide a web page into multiple sections or frames, each with its own HTML document. Frames were commonly used in the past to create complex layouts, but they are now considered outdated and not recommended for modern web development. Instead, CSS and responsive design techniques are preferred for creating flexible and mobile-friendly layouts.</p>

    

    <p>It's important to note that frames are not supported in HTML5, and modern web development practices focus on using CSS for layout and JavaScript for dynamic interactions. If you need to create a multi-column layout or include external content in your webpage, consider using CSS flexbox, grid, or other layout techniques instead of frames.</p>
